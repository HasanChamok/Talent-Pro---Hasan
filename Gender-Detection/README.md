# Gender-Detection

This will work for both Images and Videos. Run the Gender.py. This folder contain best.pt and bestNew.pt file. best.pt file was trained for gender using existing gender dataset and the training model is Training_Gender_DATA.ipynb. But the performance is very poor so i had to retrain the model with custom and my own build dataset. So Training_Gender_DATA NEW.ipynb is the newly trained model that was trained by my own custom dataset and also bestNew.pt is the new weights that performs better than previous one.
